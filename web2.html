    <h1>Types of web content</h1>
    <p>Web content includes all textual and visual content you share and publish online. It plays a significant role in engaging users and expanding brand awareness.

        Users will stay longer on your site, comment on blog posts or other content types, share your offerings with others, and even promote you on social media. In turn, you gain higher-quality leads and can see an increase in sales.</p>
